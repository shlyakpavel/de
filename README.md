Desktop Envirmoment(childhood project)/Abandoned
Useless piece of code. It was my first c++/Qt programming project. I worked on it during my childhood (11-13 years) as I wanted to make a new great Operation System and sell it to Yandex (lol). It doesnt work with new versions of Qt. If you find any copyright violations - feel free to email me (shlyak-pavel2011@ya.ru)
