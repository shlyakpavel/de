WindowsModernStyle - Modern Qt style for Windows 
Version 1.1 (2009-11-23)

WindowsModernStyle is a Qt style for Windows which imitates the look
of MS Office 2003. It changes the style of toolbars, menus, docked
windows and toolboxes. The color scheme used by this style is
automatically adjusted to system settings.

The style can be included in an existing application or compiled as
a plugin library. This package also contains a demo program using
this style.


Requirements
============

The style component and the demo program require Qt 4.3 or newer
(http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/).

The demo program can be built using the standard 'qmake' tool from Qt.
