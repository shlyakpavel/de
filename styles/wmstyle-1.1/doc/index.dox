@mainpage Modern Qt style for Windows

@section overview Overview

%WindowsModernStyle is a Qt style for Windows which imitates the look of MS Office 2003. It changes the style of toolbars, menus, docked windows and toolboxes. The color scheme used by this style is automatically adjusted to system settings.

The style can be included in an existing application or compiled as a plugin library. This package also contains a demo program using this style.

%WindowsModernStyle requires Qt 4.3 or newer, compiled with the Windows XP and Windows Vista styles enabled.
